# AI Assistant Expansion Plan: Adding Agentic Features

## Feature 2: Agent Mode

### Overview
Enable the AI assistant to edit code in the user's workspace by interpreting user requests, generating code changes, and applying them after user approval.

### Technical Implementation

1. **Workspace Access**
   - Create a `WorkspaceManager` class to handle file operations
   - Implement methods for reading, writing, and modifying files
   - Add safeguards and confirmation steps for file modifications

2. **Agent Framework**
   - Develop an `AgentExecutor` to parse AI responses for actions
   - Create a set of tools/functions the agent can use (file operations, terminal commands)
   - Implement a planning system for multi-step operations

3. **UI for Agent Interactions**
   - Add an "Agent Mode" toggle in the UI
   - Create a diff view for proposed changes
   - Implement confirmation dialogs for file operations
   - Add progress indicators for ongoing agent operations

4. **Prompt Engineering**
   - Design specialized system prompts for code editing capabilities
   - Create function calling format for the AI to request specific actions
   - Add tool descriptions and examples in the system prompt

5. **Security & Safety**
   - Implement workspace isolation (only modify permitted directories)
   - Add request validation and rate limiting
   - Create undo functionality for agent-made changes
   - Create logs of all operations performed by the agent


## Technical Debt Considerations

- Current message handling will need significant refactoring
- Token limits may require implementing compression techniques
- Need to develop clear error handling for failed agent operations
- Consider adding telemetry for feature usage and error tracking
